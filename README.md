# Programming in C

Here I am going to publish a few interesting problems solved by me on labs in Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU) during my "Programming in C" course (4th semester).

Feel free to comment them.

Each folder consists of 2 files: problem description and solution (writen on C).
